## üìÉ | Description

This is a "simple" base project that I've been developing for a few months. As the name suggests, it uses Fastify. My initial goal was to create a dynamic router, but the project evolved into something more like tRPC to meet my needs. You can also use this base in your front-end via the `packages/rpc` package, as shown below.

**Note:** This project is developed on-demand as new features are needed and does not have continuous maintenance. Do not expect regular bug fixes! ‚ö†Ô∏è

## üí° Example: How the RPC Works üõ†Ô∏è

```ts
import { Client, ErrorResponse } from 'rpc'
import type { Routers } from 'server'

const rpc = new Client<Routers>('http://0.0.0.0:3500')
const result = await rpc.query('/', 'get')

// All routes can return errors‚Äîlearn how to handle them!
// A request might not always be successful.
if (result instanceof ErrorResponse) {
  console.log(result.message)
  process.exit()
}

console.log(result.message) // hello world
```

The routes are dynamically typed, but their types are built in `server/src/rpc.ts`.

**Important:** This project does not actually implement the RPC protocol; its name is merely inspired by the tRPC project. Do not use this project in production unless you‚Äôre ready for potential headaches! üòÖ
